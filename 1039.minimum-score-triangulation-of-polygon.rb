# [1039] Minimum Score Triangulation of Polygon
#
# https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-score-triangulation-of-polygon/description/
#
# Given N, consider a convex N-sided polygon with vertices labelled
# A[0], A[i], ..., A[N-1] in clockwise order.
#
# Suppose you triangulate the polygon into N-2 triangles. For each
# triangle, the value of that triangle is the product of the labels of
# the vertices, and the total score of the triangulation is the sum of
# these values over all N-2 triangles in the triangulation.
#
# Return the smallest possible total score that you can achieve with
# some triangulation of the polygon.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: [1,2,3]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The polygon is already triangulated, and the score of
# the only triangle is 6.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: [3,7,4,5]
# Output: 144
# Explanation: There are two triangulations, with possible scores: 3*7*5 +
# 4*5*7 = 245, or 3*4*5 + 3*4*7 = 144.  The minimum score is 144.
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: [1,3,1,4,1,5]
# Output: 13
# Explanation: The minimum score triangulation has score 1*1*3 + 1*1*4
# + 1*1*5 + 1*1*1 = 13.
#
# Note:
#
# 3 <= A.length <= 50
# 1 <= A[i] <= 100
