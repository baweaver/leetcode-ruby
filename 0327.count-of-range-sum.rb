# [327] Count of Range Sum
#
# https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-range-sum/description/
#
# Given an integer array nums, return the number of range sums that
# lie in [lower, upper] inclusive. Range sum S(i, j) is defined as the
# sum of the elements in nums between indices i and j (i â‰¤ j),
# inclusive.
#
# Note: A naive algorithm of O(n2) is trivial. You MUST do better than
# that.
#
# Example:
#
# Input: nums = [-2,5,-1], lower = -2, upper = 2,
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The three ranges are : [0,0], [2,2], [0,2] and their
# respective sums are: -2, -1, 2.


# Similar to problem 315, we can use Fenwick Tree:
#
#   1. S[i] is the prefix sum up to the given point i.
#      S[-1] == 0, it's convenient for i==0.
#      - sum(i, j) = S[j] - S[i-1], we want:
#      - lower <= sum(i, j) <= upper, so that:
#      - lower + S[i-1] <= S[j] <= upper + S[i-1]
#      for all 0 <= i <= j < nums.size-1.
#      each [lower+S[i-1], S[i], S[i-1]+upper] for all i is a candidate.
#   2. R[x] is the rank of x in candidates.
#   3. P is the Fenwick tree for all candidates and it's using rank as index.
#      P[R[lower+S[i-1]], R[upper+S[i-1]]] is the current count of range
#      sum to the right of i. As it indicates that we should scan nums from
#      right to left (we need j >= i), at each index i, update current R[S[i]]
#      by 1, and add the current count of range sum to the result.
#   4. In the end, return the count number.

# @param {Integer[]} nums
# @param {Integer} lower
# @param {Integer} upper
# @return {Integer}
