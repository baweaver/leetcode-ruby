# [1035] Uncrossed Lines
#
# https://leetcode.com/problems/uncrossed-lines/description/
#
# We write the integers of A and B (in the order they are given) on
# two separate horizontal lines.
#
# Now, we may draw a straight line connecting two numbers A[i] and
# B[j] as long as A[i] == B[j], and the line we draw does not
# intersect any other connecting (non-horizontal) line.
#
# Return the maximum number of connecting lines we can draw in this way.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: A = [1,4,2], B = [1,2,4]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: We can draw 2 uncrossed lines as in the diagram.
# We cannot draw 3 uncrossed lines, because the line from A[1]=4 to B[2]=4 will
# intersect the line from A[2]=2 to B[1]=2.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: A = [2,5,1,2,5], B = [10,5,2,1,5,2]
# Output: 3
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: A = [1,3,7,1,7,5], B = [1,9,2,5,1]
# Output: 2
#
# Note:
#
# 1 <= A.length <= 500
# 1 <= B.length <= 500
# 1 <= A[i], B[i] <= 2000
