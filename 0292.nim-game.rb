# [292] Nim Game
#
# https://leetcode.com/problems/nim-game/description/
#
# You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend: There is a
# heap of stones on the table, each time one of you take turns to
# remove 1 to 3 stones. The one who removes the last stone will be the
# winner. You will take the first turn to remove the stones.
# 
# Both of you are very clever and have optimal strategies for the
# game. Write a function to determine whether you can win the game
# given the number of stones in the heap.
# 
# Example:
# 
# Input: 4
# Output: false 
# Explanation: If there are 4 stones in the heap, then you will never
# win the game; No matter 1, 2, or 3 stones you remove, the last stone
# will always be removed by your friend.


# @param {Integer} n
# @return {Boolean}
