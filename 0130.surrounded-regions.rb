# [130] Surrounded Regions
#
# https://leetcode.com/problems/surrounded-regions/description/
#
# Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all
# regions surrounded by 'X'.
#
# A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that
# surrounded region.
#
# Example:
#
# X X X X
# X O O X
# X X O X
# X O X X
#
# After running your function, the board should be:
#
# X X X X
# X X X X
# X X X X
# X O X X
#
# Explanation:
#
# Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means that any
# 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'. Any 'O' that
# is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border
# will be flipped to 'X'. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent
# cells connected horizontally or vertically.


# Using Union-Find, the idea is simple
#
#   1. Union all the 'O's together.
#   2. Union all 'O's on border to a dummy-node.
#   3. Flip all 'O's to 'X's which are not connected to the dummy-node.

# @param {Character[][]} board
# @return {Void} Do not return anything, modify board in-place instead.

# Another approach is using search, the idea is also simple:
#
#   1. Search through all 'O's on border and mark them as '*'.
#   2. Flip all 'O's to 'X' since it's not connected to border.
#   3. Flip all '*'s back to 'O'.
