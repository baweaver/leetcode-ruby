# Given string contains only 'a' and 'b', their are 2 ops you can do:
#
#   1. flip a to b at certain index.
#   2. flip b to a at certain index.
#
# Find minimum ops you can do after which the string is sorted
# (a...ab...b), return the sorted string.


# Given "ababbab"
#   1. From right to left count the number of 'a's up to given point.
#      there is a dummy node 0 at the end.
#      [3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
#   2. From left to right count the number of 'b's up to given point.
#      there is a dummy node 0 at the start.
#      [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4]
#   3. For each character, check how many 'b's are there to the left,
#      and how many 'a's to the right, sum it together, update the minimum
#      if it's smaller, keep record of the current index, after iteration,
#      rebuild the string using the index.
