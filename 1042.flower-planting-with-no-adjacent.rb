# [1042] Flower Planting With No Adjacent
#
# https://leetcode.com/problems/flower-planting-with-no-adjacent/description/
#
# You have N gardens, labelled 1 to N. In each garden, you want to
# plant one of 4 types of flowers.
#
# paths[i] = [x, y] describes the existence of a bidirectional path
# from garden x to garden y.
#
# Also, there is no garden that has more than 3 paths coming into or
# leaving it.
#
# Your task is to choose a flower type for each garden such that, for any two
# gardens connected by a path, they have different types of flowers.
#
# Return any such a choice as an array answer, where answer[i] is the type of
# flower planted in the (i+1)-th garden. The flower types are denoted 1, 2, 3,
# or 4. It is guaranteed an answer exists.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: N = 3, paths = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]
# Output: [1,2,3]
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: N = 4, paths = [[1,2],[3,4]]
# Output: [1,2,1,2]
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: N = 4, paths = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,1],[1,3],[2,4]]
# Output: [1,2,3,4]
#
# Note:
#
# 1 <= N <= 10000
# 0 <= paths.size <= 20000
# No garden has 4 or more paths coming into or leaving it.
# It is guaranteed an answer exists.


# The key is that there's always an available color for each garden,
# so just greedily paint all gardens.

# @param {Integer} n
# @param {Integer[][]} paths
# @return {Integer[]}
