# Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end
# times [[s1,e1],[s2,e2],...] (si < ei), find the minimum number of
# conference rooms required.
#
# Example:
#
# Given [[0, 30],[5, 10],[15, 20]],
#
# return 2.
#
# Definition for an interval.
# class Interval
#     attr_accessor :start, :end
#     def initialize(s=0, e=0)
#         @start = s
#         @end = e
#     end
# end


# If you put all intervals on a 1d line, then the rooms we need at any
# given point x would be the same as the number of intersections if we
# draw a vertical line at point x. Using this idea, we can do simple
# line-sweep from left to right and keep record of the maximum number
# of intersections. To calculate the intersections, we don't have to
# iterate through all integers, we just need to consider all the start
# points and end points.
