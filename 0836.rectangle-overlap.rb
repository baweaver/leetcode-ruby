# [836] Rectangle Overlap
#
# https://leetcode.com/problems/rectangle-overlap/description/
#
# A rectangle is represented as a list [x1, y1, x2, y2], where (x1,
# y1) are the coordinates of its bottom-left corner, and (x2, y2) are
# the coordinates of its top-right corner.
#
# Two rectangles overlap if the area of their intersection is
# positive. To be clear, two rectangles that only touch at the corner
# or edges do not overlap.
#
# Given two (axis-aligned) rectangles, return whether they overlap.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: rec1 = [0,0,2,2], rec2 = [1,1,3,3]
# Output: true
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: rec1 = [0,0,1,1], rec2 = [1,0,2,1]
# Output: false
#
# Notes:
#
# Both rectangles rec1 and rec2 are lists of 4 integers.
# All coordinates in rectangles will be betweenÂ -10^9 and 10^9.


# @param {Integer[]} rec1
# @param {Integer[]} rec2
# @return {Boolean}
