# [126] Word Ladder II
#
# https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder-ii/description/
#
# Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word
# list, find all shortest transformation sequence(s) from beginWord to
# endWord, such that:
#
# Only one letter can be changed at a time Each transformed word must
# exist in the word list. Note that beginWord is not a transformed
# word.
#
# Note:
#
# Return an empty list if there is no such transformation sequence.
# All words have the same length.
# All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
# You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
# You may assume beginWord and endWord are non-empty and are not the same.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input:
# beginWord = "hit",
# endWord = "cog",
# wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
#
# Output:
# [
# ‚Å† ["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],
# ["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]
# ]
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input:
# beginWord = "hit"
# endWord = "cog"
# wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
#
# Output: []
#
# Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible
# transformation.
