# [210] Course Schedule II
#
# https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/description/
#
# There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.
#
# Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0
# you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]
#
# Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, return
# the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses.
#
# There may be multiple correct orders, you just need to return one of them. If
# it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: 2, [[1,0]]
# Output: [0,1]
# Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course
# 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is
# [0,1] .
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: 4, [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
# Output: [0,1,2,3] or [0,2,1,3]
# Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course
# 3 you should have finished both ‚Å† courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and
# 2 should be taken after you finished course 0. So one correct course
# order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3] .
#
# Note:
#
# The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not
# adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
# You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.


# Topological Sort. See https://youtu.be/AfSk24UTFS8?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb&t=2516

# We don't need to use 'processing' if we do the checking with
# 'parent.has_key?(x) && !topo.include?(x)', but 'include?' method is
